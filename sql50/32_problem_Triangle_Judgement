Triangle Judgement:

Table: Triangle
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.
 
Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

solution 1:
  select *,
      case 
          when x=y and x=z
          then "Yes"
          when x>=y and x>=z and y+z>x
          then "Yes"
          when y>=x and y>=z and x+z>y
          then "Yes"
          when z>=x and z>=y and x+y>z
          then "Yes"
          else "No"
      end as triangle
  from Triangle;

solution 2:(more optimized condition)
  select x,y,z,
  case 
    when (x+y) > z and (x+z) > y and (y+z) > x then 'Yes'
    else 'No'
  end as triangle
  from Triangle;
