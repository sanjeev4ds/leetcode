Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports:
Table: Employee
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Solution 1:
select name
from
(
    select managerId, count(id) as num_employees
    from Employee
    where managerId is not null
    group by managerId
    having num_employees>=5
) as s1
left join Employee
on s1.managerId= Employee.id
where Employee.id is not null;

Solution 2: (more optimized query)
select name
from Employee
where id in
(
    select managerId
    from Employee
    group by managerId
    having count(id)>=5
);
