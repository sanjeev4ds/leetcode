Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends:

Table: RequestAccepted
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.
The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.
The result format is in the following example.

solution 1:
  with cte_id_countFriends as (
      select id, count(friend_id) as num
      from
      (
          select accepter_id  as id,
          requester_id as friend_id
          from RequestAccepted
  
          union distinct
  
          select requester_id  as id,
          accepter_id as friend_id
          from RequestAccepted
      ) as s1
      group by s1.id
  )
  
  select id, num
  from cte_id_countFriends
  where num= (
      select max(num) from cte_id_countFriends
  );
