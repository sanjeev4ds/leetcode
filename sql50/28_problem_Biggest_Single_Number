Biggest Single Number:

Table: MyNumbers
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.
 
A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.
Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.
The result format is in the following example.

solution 1:
  select num from (
      select null as num
      union all
      (
          select num
          from MyNumbers
          group by num
          having count(*)=1
      ) 
  ) as s1
  order by num desc
  limit 1;

solution 2: (using max)
select max(num) as num from
(
    select num
    from MyNumbers
    group by num
    having count(*)=1
) as s1;

  important note for solution 2 :
  we can not use max in same query while using group by as it will not actually consider max operation is same query,
  below query will not able to provide result for maximum num-

    select max(num) as num
    from MyNumbers
    group by num
    having count(*)=1;

solution 3: (using subquery)
  select max(num) as num
  from MyNumbers
  where num in
  (
      select num 
      from MyNumbers 
      group by num
      having count(*)=1
  );
