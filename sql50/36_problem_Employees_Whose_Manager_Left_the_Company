Employees Whose Manager Left the Company:

Table: Employees
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 
Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
The result format is in the following example.

solution 1:
  with cte_required_employees as (
      select employee_id, manager_id
      from Employees
      where salary<30000
  )
  
  select employee_id
  from cte_required_employees
  where manager_id not in (
      select employee_id
      from Employees
  )
  order by employee_id;

solution 2:
  select e1.employee_id
  from Employees e1
  left join Employees e2
  on e1.manager_id= e2.employee_id
  where e1.salary<30000
  and e1.manager_id is not null
  and e2.employee_id is null
  order by e1.employee_id;
