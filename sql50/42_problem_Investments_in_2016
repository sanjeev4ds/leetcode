Investments in 2016:

Table: Insurance
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| pid         | int   |
| tiv_2015    | float |
| tiv_2016    | float |
| lat         | float |
| lon         | float |
+-------------+-------+
pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:
pid is the policyholder's policy ID.
tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.
lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.
lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.
 
Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:
have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

solution 1: (easiest using partition by)
  select round(sum(tiv_2016),2) as tiv_2016
  from
  (
      select tiv_2016,
      count(*) over (partition by tiv_2015) as count_tiv_2015,
      count(*) over (partition by concat(lat,lon)) as count_lat_long
      from Insurance
  ) as s1
  where count_tiv_2015>1 and count_lat_long=1;

solution 2: (with cte and separate queries)
  with cte_multiple_times as (
      select tiv_2015
      from Insurance
      group by tiv_2015
      having count(*)>1
  ),
  cte_latlon_count as (
      select pid
      from Insurance
      group by concat(lat,lon)
      having count(*)=1
  )
  
  select round(sum(tiv_2016),2) as tiv_2016
  from Insurance
  where tiv_2015 in (select tiv_2015 from cte_multiple_times)
  and pid in (select pid from cte_latlon_count);

solution 3: (using subqueries only)
  select round(sum(tiv_2016),2) as tiv_2016
  from Insurance
  where tiv_2015 in (
      select tiv_2015
      from Insurance
      group by tiv_2015
      having count(*)>1
  )
  and pid in (
      select pid
      from Insurance
      group by concat(lat,lon)
      having count(*)=1
  );
