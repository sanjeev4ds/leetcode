Game Play Analysis IV:

Table: Activity
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 
Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. 
In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

solution 1:
  with cte_player_mindate as (
      select player_id, min(event_date) as min_date
      from Activity
      group by player_id
  )
  
  select Round(count(Activity.player_id)/(select count(distinct(player_id)) from Activity),2) as fraction
  from Activity
  inner join cte_player_mindate
  on Activity.player_id= cte_player_mindate.player_id
  and datediff(event_date,min_date)=1;

Solution 2: (using subquery)
select Round( count(distinct player_id)/ (select count(distinct player_id) from Activity), 2) as fraction
from Activity
where (player_id, Date_sub(event_date, Interval 1 day))
in (select player_id, min(event_date) as first_login from activity group by player_id);

solution 3: (subquery with cte)
with cte_player_firstlogin as (
    select player_id, min(event_date) as first_login from activity group by player_id
)
select Round( count(distinct player_id)/ (select count(distinct player_id) from Activity), 2) as fraction
from Activity
where (player_id, Date_sub(event_date, Interval 1 day)) in (select * from cte_player_firstlogin);
