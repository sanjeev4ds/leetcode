Average Selling Price:

Table: Prices
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 
Table: UnitsSold
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 
Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Solution 1:
select Prices.product_id, 
if(
    round(sum(Prices.price*UnitsSold.units)/sum(UnitsSold.units),2) is not null,
    round(sum(Prices.price*UnitsSold.units)/sum(UnitsSold.units),2),
    0
) as average_price
from Prices
left join UnitsSold
on Prices.product_id= UnitsSold.product_id
and UnitsSold.purchase_date >=Prices.start_date
and UnitsSold.purchase_date <=Prices.end_date
group by Prices.product_id;
