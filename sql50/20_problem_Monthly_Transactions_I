Monthly Transactions I:

Table: Transactions
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| country       | varchar |
| state         | enum    |
| amount        | int     |
| trans_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].
 
Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

solution 1:
  select date_format(trans_date, "%Y-%m") as month,
  country,
  count(*) as trans_count,
  sum(if(state="approved",1,0)) as approved_count,
  sum(amount) as trans_total_amount,
  sum(if(state="approved", amount, 0)) as approved_total_amount
  from Transactions
  group by date_format(trans_date, "%Y-%m"),country;

solution 2: (using month column in group statement)
  select date_format(trans_date, "%Y-%m") as month,
  country,
  count(*) as trans_count,
  sum(if(state="approved",1,0)) as approved_count,
  sum(amount) as trans_total_amount,
  sum(if(state="approved", amount, 0)) as approved_total_amount
  from Transactions
  group by month,country;

solution 3: (using left, also bool(1/0) directly in sum)
  select LEFT(trans_date,7) as month,
  country,
  count(*) as trans_count,
  sum(state="approved") as approved_count,
  sum(amount) as trans_total_amount,
  sum((state="approved")*amount) as approved_total_amount
  from Transactions
  group by month,country;
