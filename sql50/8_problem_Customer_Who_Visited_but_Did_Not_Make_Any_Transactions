Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions:

Table: Visits
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.
 

Table: Transactions
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |
| amount         | int     |
+----------------+---------+
transaction_id is column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.

Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.
Return the result table sorted in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Solution 1:
  select customer_id, count(*) as count_no_trans
  from Visits
  left join Transactions
  on Transactions.visit_id= Visits.visit_id
  where Transactions.visit_id is null
  group by customer_id;

solution 2: (just using one subquery)
  select customer_id, count(visit_id) as count_no_trans
  from Visits
  where visit_id not in (select visit_id from Transactions)
  group by customer_id;

Solution 3: (using- NOT EXISTS) {very rarely I have used earlier)
  select customer_id, count(visit_id) as count_no_trans
  from Visits
  where not Exists (
      select Transactions.visit_id from Transactions
      where Visits.visit_id = Transactions.visit_id
  )
  group by customer_id;
