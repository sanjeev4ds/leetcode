Rising Temperature:

Table: Weather
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 
Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Solution 1:
-- w1 is current_day and w2 is yesterday
select w1.id
from Weather w1,
weather w2
where datediff(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate)=1
and w1.temperature>w2.temperature;

Solution 2:
-- w1 is current_day and w2 is yesterday
select w1.id as Id
from Weather w1
where Exists (
    select 1
    from weather w2
    where w1.temperature > w2.temperature
    and w1.recordDate= w2.recordDate+ INTERVAL 1 DAY
);
