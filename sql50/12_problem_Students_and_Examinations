Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam.
Return the result table ordered by student_id and subject_name.
The result format is in the following example.

Solution 1:
  select s1.student_id, s1.student_name, s1.subject_name,
  count(Examinations.subject_name) as attended_exams
  from
  (
      select Students.student_id, Students.student_name, subject_name
      from Students, Subjects
  ) as s1
  left join Examinations
  on Examinations.student_id = s1.student_id
  and Examinations.subject_name=  s1.subject_name
  group by s1.student_id, s1.student_name, s1.subject_name
  order by s1.student_id, s1.subject_name;

Solution 2: (above same solution and without subquery)
  select Students.student_id, Students.student_name, Subjects.subject_name, 
  count(Examinations.subject_name) as attended_exams
  from Students
  Cross join Subjects
  left join Examinations
  on Examinations.student_id = Students.student_id
