Immediate Food Delivery II:

Table: Delivery
+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.
The result format is in the following example.

solution 1: (with rank window function)
  with cte_rank as (
      select customer_id,order_date,customer_pref_delivery_date,
      rank() over (partition by customer_id order by order_date) as rank_
      from Delivery
  )
  
  select Round((count(*)/(select count(distinct(customer_id)) from Delivery))*100,2) as immediate_percentage
  from cte_rank
  where rank_=1 and order_date= customer_pref_delivery_date;

solution 2: (slightly modifying it)
  with cte as (
      select customer_id,order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date,
      rank() over (partition by customer_id order by order_date) as rank_
      from Delivery
  )
  
  select Round(
      (
          (select count(customer_id) from cte where rank_=1 and order_date= customer_pref_delivery_date)/ 
          (select count(distinct(customer_id)) from Delivery)
      )*100
  ,2) as immediate_percentage;

solution 3:
  select round(avg(order_date=customer_pref_delivery_date)*100,2) as immediate_percentage
  from Delivery
  where (customer_id, order_date) in (
      select customer_id, min(order_date)
      from Delivery
      group by customer_id
  );
