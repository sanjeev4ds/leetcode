Consecutive Numbers:

Table: Logs
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
 
Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.


solution 1: (using window function)
  select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums
  from
  (
      select num, lead(num) over (order by id) as lead_, lag(num) over (order by id) as lag_
      from Logs
  ) as s1
  where num=lead_ and num=lag_;

solution 2: (using subquery)
  select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums
  from Logs
  where (id+1, Num) in (select * from Logs) 
  and (Id+2,Num) in (select * from Logs);
